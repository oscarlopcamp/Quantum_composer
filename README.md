# Quantum_composer
An interactive and offline educational tool to build and visualize quantum circuits locally. Built with Python, Qiskit, and PyQt5, this quantum composer enables users to apply quantum gates, view circuit diagrams, simulate measurement outcomes, and explore qubit states using Bloch spheres and histograms â€” all without internet access.
